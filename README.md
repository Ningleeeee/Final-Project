## About Savour
<p>In Luxembourg alone, an average of 118 kg of food waste per person ends up in the bin each year.
 Creating food consumes a lot of energy and often results in long transport routes. <br>
 Our goal is to save energy by providing restaurants with the opportunity to offload meals <br> that are due to be spoiled</p>
 
## Why Savour
<p>We offer our users the opportunity to enjoy meals that are approaching their expiration date at a discounted price. <br>
The user can browse our restaurants and meals to see what is available each day. <br>The user can create an account, place their order, and make their payment through our website.</p>
